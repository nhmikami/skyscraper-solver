## What is a skyscraper puzzle?
The Skyscraper Puzzle is a logic-based game that involves placing skyscrapers of different heights in a grid. The goal is to correctly position the skyscrapers in a way that satisfies specific rules about visibility and arrangement.<br />
* The grid is typically square (4x4 to NxN)
* The number of skyscrapers corresponds to the size of the grid
* Each number in the puzzle corresponds to the height of a skyscraper
* Along the edges of the grid, there are numbers ("clues") that tell you how many skyscrapers are visible from that particular vantage point when looking across the row or column
* Visibility means that a taller building blocks the view of shorter buildings behind it
* No two skyscrapers of the same height can appear in the same row or column (no duplicates)

The objective is to place the skyscrapers in the grid so that all the conditions are met: each row and column contains a unique set of heights (1 through N), and the visibility clues for each row and column are satisfied.<br />
